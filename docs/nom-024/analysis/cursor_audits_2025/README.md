# Cursor Audits (Historical)

These documents were generated as early compliance audits based on partial inputs.
They are **not normative sources** and may contain assumptions.

Use them only as:
- navigation aids (file paths, entity discovery)
- initial hypotheses to validate against the authoritative technical sources in:
  - docs/nom-024/nom024_core_requirements.md
  - docs/nom-024/giis_*.md
  - catalogs/README.md and catalogs/normalized/*
